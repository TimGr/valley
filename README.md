  # Valley Theme for Visual Studio Code
  [Valley](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGrochowski.valley-vscode) is a simple theme for Visual Studio Code without visual noise. Created with handpicked and vivid colors, appropriate contrast and a lot of love to help you focus on your code.

## üöÄ My motivation to build Valley
>I've always had this feeling about themes like: "If I use this theme it makes me a better developer", which is of course totally stupid, but I've always had this feeling and changed my theme many times. But I didn't felt completely comfortable with any of it and was kind of blocked in my work. Because colors were not harmonious, contrasts were missing or much too strong. And all in all, I always lacked orientation because there was a lack of design in some way. And so I have developed my own. Of course this is a **very personal perception**, and this theme won't fit 100% for some people either. But maybe only a few people have as much fun with Valley as I do.

## üì¶ How to Install
- Open the **"Extensions"** sidebar in Visual Studio Code
- Search for `Valley`
- Choose "Valley" by Tim Grochowski and click **"Install"**
- [Select the Theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme)

**or via "Quick Open, Go to File..."**

**To improve orientation, I have colored the surfaces according to their z-axis. The closer a surface is to the user, the brighter it is.**

**I have tried to be AA compliant and achieve a contrast ratio of 4.5 for all main color combinations.**

**Features like search or Git have their own color palette and are consistent in their use. For example, all search-related colors are consistently yellow.**

The syntax color palette was partly inspired by the Google Chrome DevTools Theme (in darkmode). I used language scopes from the Visual Studio Code Dark+ Theme to jumpstart Valley.
