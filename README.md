  # Valley Theme for Visual Studio Code
  [Valley](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGrochowski.valley-vscode) is a simple theme for Visual Studio Code without visual noise. Created with handpicked and vivid colors, appropriate contrast and a lot of love to help you focus on your code.

**To improve orientation, I have colored the surfaces according to their z-axis. The closer the surface is to the user, the brighter it is.**

**I have tried to be AA compliant and achieve a contrast ratio of 4.5 for all main color combinations.**

**Features like search or Git have their own color palette and are consistent in their use. For example, all search-related colors are consistently yellow.**

The syntax color palette was partly inspired by the Google Chrome DevTools Theme (in darkmode). I used language scopes from the Visual Studio Code Dark+ Theme to jumpstart Valley.

Valley is available for free in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGrochowski.valley-vscode). If you enjoy using it and want to say thank you then you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TimGr).
